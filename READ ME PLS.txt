if you want to test admin
 username: admin
 password: adminpass

so far the users in the database are:
 username: dj
 password: dj123
 (they made the YAY note)

 username: test
 password: test123

I'm not completely done with admin page yet, cus i gotta fix the problem of the index.html opening instead of the login when I flask run.
